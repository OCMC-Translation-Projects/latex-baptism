The Priest unties the girdle of the one who is about to be enlightened and divests them of outer clothing and shoes. He stands them facing East, wearing only a tunic, unbelted, bareheaded and barefoot, with the hands down. He breathes on their face three times, signs the forehead and breast three times.

In your name, O Lord God of truth, and of your Only-Begotten Son and your Holy Spirit, I place my hand on the head of your servant N., who has been counted worthy to take refuge in your holy Name and to be guarded under the shelter of your wings. Remove from him/her that ancient error and fill him/her with faith in you, and hope and love, so that he/she may know that you alone are God, true God, and your Only-Begotten Son, our Lord Jesus Christ, and your Holy Spirit. Grant that he/she may walk in your commandments and preserve those things that are pleasing to you, for if someone does them, they will live by them. Inscribe him/her in your book of life and unite him/her to the flock of your inheritance. Let your holy Name and that of your beloved Son, our Lord Jesus Christ and of your life-giving Spirit, be glorified in him/her. Let your eyes remain ever fixed in mercy on him/her, and your ears to hear the voice of his/her supplication. Make him/her glad in the works of his/her hands and in all his/her race, that he/she may confess you, worshipping and glorifying your great and most high Name, and may praise you throughout all the days of his/her life. For every power of heaven sings your praise, and yours is the glory, of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit, now and for ever, and to the ages of ages. Amen.

The Lord rebukes you, O Devil, the Lord who came into the world and dwelt among mortals so that he might destroy your tyranny and deliver humanity; the Lord who on the Tree crushed the hostile powers, when the sun was darkened, the earth shaken, the graves opened and the bodies of Saints arose; the Lord who by death abolished death and destroyed the one who had the power of death, that is you, the Devil. I adjure you by God, who revealed the tree of life and set in place the Cherubim and the flaming sword which turned this way and that to guard it: Be rebuked and withdraw! I adjure you by the One who walked on the surface of the sea as on dry land and rebuked the tempest of the winds, the One whose gaze dries up the deeps and whose curse melts mountains. For it is he who now commands you, through us: Be afraid, come out, withdraw from this creature and return no more. Do not hide in him/her, nor encounter him/her, nor influence him/her either by night or day, early or at noon. But go back to your own Tartarus until the great day of the judgement that has been prepared. Be afraid of God, who is seated upon the Cherubim and looks upon the deeps; before whom Angels, Archangels, Thrones, Dominions, Principalities, Authorities, Powers, the many-eyed Cherubim and the six-winged Seraphim tremble; before whom heaven and earth, the sea and all that is in them tremble. Come out, and withdraw from the sealed and newly-enlisted soldier of Christ our God. For it is by him that I adjure you, the One who walks on the wings of the winds, who makes his Angels spirits and his ministers a flaming fire. Come out, and withdraw from this creature with all your power and your angels. For the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit has been glorified, now and for ever, and to the ages of ages.

It is God, the Holy One, who is beyond understanding and unsearchable in all his works and in his strength, the One who foreordained for you, O Devil, the penalty of eternal damnation, that through us, his unprofitable servants, orders you, and every power that works with you, to depart from the one who has been newly sealed in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, our true God. I adjure you, most evil, unclean, foul, abominable and alien spirit, by the power of Jesus Christ, who has all authority in heaven and on earth and who said to the deaf and dumb demon, ‘Come out of the man, and enter him no more!’ Depart! Acknowledge the futility of your power, which had no authority even over swine. Remember the One who ordered you, in accordance with your own request, to enter the herd of swine. Fear God, at whose command the earth was established upon the waters, who created the heavens and fixed the mountains with a king post and the valleys with a cross-beam, placed sand as a boundary for the sea and made a safe path through wild water; who touches the mountains and they smoke; who wraps himself in light as in a garment, stretching out the heavens like a tent cloth; who roofs his upper chambers with waters; who established the earth on its foundations; it will not be moved for to age on age; who summoned the water of the sea and poured it out upon the face of the earth. Come and depart from one who is being made ready for holy Enlightenment. I adjure you by the saving Passion of our Lord Jesus Christ, by his precious Body and Blood and his dread Coming; for he will come, and he will not delay, to judge the whole earth and he will condemn you and the power that works with you to the Gehenna of fire, handing you over to the exterior darkness, where the worm is unsleeping and the fire is not quenched. Because the might is Christ our God's, with the Father and the Holy Spirit, now and for ever, and to the ages of ages.

Lord Sabaoth, God of Israel, who heal every disease and every sickness, look upon your servant, search out, seek and drive from him/her all the activities of the devil. Rebuke the unclean spirits and expel them, and cleanse the work of your hands; and using your swift force, crush Satan speedily under his/her feet and grant him/her victories against him and all his unclean spirits, so that, obtaining mercy from you, he/she may be found worthy of your immortal and heavenly Mysteries and may give glory to you, the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit, now and for ever, and to the ages of ages.

Master and Lord, the One who Is, who made man according to your image and likeness and gave him the power of eternal life; then, when he fell through sin, did not disdain him, but provided for the salvation of the world through the incarnation of your Christ, do you yourself receive also this creature of yours, whom you have redeemed from the slavery of the foe, into the heavenly Kingdom. Open the eyes of his/her mind so that the enlightenment of your Gospel may dawn on him/her. Yoke to his/her life an Angel of light, to deliver him/her from every attack of the adversary, from evil encounter, from the noon-day demon, from evil visions.

Then the Priest breathes on the mouth, forehead and breast of the Catechumen, saying:

%<*"p0054">

%</"p0054">
%<*"p0055">
Drive out of him/her every evil and unclean spirit hiding and lurking in his/her heart.
%</"p0055">
%<*"p0056">
The spirit of error, the spirit of wickedness, the spirit of idolatry and diabolic oppression; the spirit of lying and every uncleanness which operates in accordance with the teaching of the devil. And make him/her a rational sheep of the flock of your Christ, an honoured member of your Church, a vessel made holy, a child of light and an heir of your Kingdom. So that, having lived in accordance with your commandments, preserving the seal undamaged and keeping his/her garment undefiled, he/she may attain to the blessedness of the Saints in your Kingdom.

%<*"p0057">
By the grace and pity and love for mankind of your Only-Begotten Son, with whom you are blessed, together with your all-holy, good and life-giving Spirit, now and for ever, and to the ages of ages.

When the Catechumen is undressed and unshod, the Priest turns him/her to the West with hands raised on high, and says:
%</"p0060">
%<*"p0061">
duplicates.d0779
%</"p0061">
%<*"p0062">
Do you renounce Satan? And all his works? And all his angels? And all his worship? And all his solemn rites?
%</"p0062">
%<*"p0063">
And to each question the Catechumen, or the Godparent, if the catechumen is a barbarian or a child, answers and says:
%</"p0063">
%<*"p0064">
I renounce them.
%</"p0064">
%<*"p0065">
And when he/she has said this three times, the Priest again asks the one to be baptized:
%</"p0065">
%<*"p0066">
duplicates.d0779
%</"p0066">
%<*"p0067">
Have you renounced Satan?
%</"p0067">
%<*"p0068">
duplicates.d0125
%</"p0068">
%<*"p0069">
 I have renounced him.
%</"p0069">
%<*"p0070">
After he/she has said this three times the Priest says:

duplicates.d0779
%</"p0071">
%<*"p0072">
Then blow and spit on him.
%</"p0072">
%<*"p0073">
After this the Priest turns the Catechumen to the East with lowered hands and says to him/her three times:
%</"p0073">
%<*"p0074">
duplicates.d0779
%</"p0074">
%<*"p0075">
Do you unite yourself to Christ?
%</"p0075">
%<*"p0076">
The Catechumen, or Godparent, answers three times:
%</"p0076">
%<*"p0077">
 I unite myself to him.
%</"p0077">
%<*"p0078">
And again the Priest asks three times:

%</"p0079">
%<*"p0080">
duplicates.d0445

%</"p0081">
%<*"p0082">
duplicates.d0227
%</"p0082">
%<*"p0083">
And the Priest asks:
%</"p0083">
%<*"p0084">
duplicates.d0779
%</"p0084">
%<*"p0085">
And do you believe in him?
%</"p0085">
%<*"p0086">
The Catechumen, or Godparent, answers:
%</"p0086">
%<*"p0087">
 I believe in him as King and God,
%</"p0087">
%<*"p0088">
and continues:
%</"p0088">
%<*"p0089">
I believe in one God, Father almighty, Maker of heaven and earth, and of all things visible and invisible.
%</"p0089">
%<*"p0090">
And in one Lord, Jesus Christ, the only-begotten Son of God, begotten from the Father before all ages. Light from Light, true God from true God, begotten not made, consubstantial with the Father; through him all things were made; for our sake and for our salvation he came down from heaven, and was incarnate from the Holy Spirit and the Virgin Mary and became man; he was crucified also for us under Pontius Pilate, and suffered and was buried; he rose again on the third day, in accordance with the Scriptures, and ascended into heaven and is seated at the right hand of the Father; he is coming again in glory to judge the living and the dead; and his kingdom will have no end.
%</"p0090">
%<*"p0091">
And in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the Giver of life, who proceeds from the Father, who together with Father and Son is worshipped and together glorified; who spoke through the Prophets. In one Holy, Catholic and Apostolic Church; I confess one Baptism for the forgiveness of sins; I await the resurrection of the dead and the life of the age to come. Amen.
%</"p0091">
%<*"p0092a">
When the holy Profession of faith has been completed [the Priest again asks three times: 
%</"p0092a">
%<*"p0092b">
Have you united yourself to Christ? 
%</"p0092b">
%<*"p0092c">
and the rest. The Catechumen, or the Godparent, answers each time as before. After the third question and the third recitation of the Creed] the Priest asks three times:

%<*"p0096">

duplicates.d0779
%</"p0098">
%<*"p0099">
Bow down also and worship him.
%</"p0099">
%<*"p0100">
The candidate makes a prostration, saying:
%</"p0100">
%<*"p0101">
 I worship Father, Son and Holy Spirit, Trinity consubstantial and undivided.
%</"p0101">
%<*"p0102">
The Priest says:

%<*"p0103">
Blessed is God who wishes all to be saved and come to the knowledge of the truth, now and for ever, and to the ages of ages. Amen.

Compassionate and merciful God, you test minds and hearts and alone know the secrets of mortals, for no deed is hidden in your sight, but everything is naked and exposed to your eyes. You know all about me; do not then despise me or turn your face from me, but overlook my offences at this hour, you who overlook the sins of mortals for their repentance. Wash away the filth of my body and the defilement of my soul by the power of your invisible and spiritual right hand, lest, as I proclaim freedom to others and grant it by the perfect faith of your ineffable love for mankind, I myself, as a slave of sin, become unworthy of it. May I not, Master, alone good and lover of mankind, may I not be turned away humiliated and put to shame, but from on high send power out to me and give me strength for your great and heavenly Mystery which lies before me, and through my miserable person form your Christ in the one who is about to be reborn. Build him/her up on the foundation of your Apostles and Prophets, and do not pull him/her down, but plant him/her as a plant of truth in your holy Catholic and Apostolic Church, and do not pull him/her out. So that by his/her progressing in true religion, your all-holy name, of Father, Son and Holy Spirit, may be glorified also through him/her, now and for ever, and to the ages of ages. Amen.

For as by your will you brought the universe from non-existence into being, by your might you uphold creation and by your providence you direct the world. From four elements you composed the world, with four seasons you crowned the circle of the year. All the spiritual Powers tremble before you. The sun sings your praise, the moon glorifies you, the stars entreat you, the light obeys you, the deeps tremble before you, the springs are your servants. You stretched out the heaven like a curtain; you established the earth on the waters; you walled in the sea with sand; you poured out the air for breathing. Angelic Powers minister to you, the choirs of Archangels worship you, the many-eyed Cherubim and the six-winged Seraphim, as they stand and fly around you, veil themselves in fear of your unapproachable glory. For you, God uncircumscribed, without beginning and ineffable, came upon earth taking the form of a slave, being found in the likeness of mortals. For through the compassion of your mercy, Master, you could not endure to watch the human race being tyrannized by the devil, but you came and saved us. We confess your grace, we proclaim your mercy, we do not conceal your benevolence. You set at liberty the generations of our nature, you sanctified a virgin womb by your birth. All creation sang your praise when you appeared. For you, our God, were seen on earth and lived among mortals. You also sanctified the streams of Jordan by sending down to them from heaven your all-holy Spirit, and you crushed the heads of the dragons that lurked there.

We pray you, Lord, let all airy and invisible specters withdraw from us, and do not let a demon of darkness hide itself in this water, and do not let an evil spirit, bringing darkening of thoughts and disturbance of mind, go down into it with the one who is being baptized. But do you, Master of all things, declare this water to be water of redemption, water of sanctification, cleansing of flesh and spirit, untying of bonds, forgiveness of offences, enlightenment of soul, washing of rebirth, renewal of spirit, gift of adoption, garment of incorruption, source of life. For it was you, Lord, who said, ‘Wash and be made clean, and put away evils from your souls’. It is you who have given us the grace of rebirth from on high through water and Spirit. Manifest yourself, Lord, in this water, and grant that the one being baptized in it may be transformed for the putting off of the old self that is corrupted after the desires of deception, and may put on the new that is renewed after the image of the One who created him/her. So that, planted in the likeness of your death through Baptism, he/she may also become a partaker in your Resurrection, and having guarded the gift of the Holy Spirit and increased the deposit of grace, may receive the prize of his/her high calling and be numbered with the firstborn, whose names are inscribed in heaven, in you our God and Lord, Jesus Christ. Because to you belong glory, might, honour and worship, together with your Father who is without beginning and your all-holy, good, and life-giving Spirit, now and for ever, and to the ages of ages.

Blessed are those whose iniquities have been forgiven and whose sins have been covered.
%</"p0220">
%<*"p0221">
Blessed is the one to whom the Lord imputes no sin and in whose mouth there is no guile. Because I kept silent my bones grew old from my crying out all day long. Because night and day your hand was heavy upon me; I was turned to wretchedness by a thorn's being fastened in me. I acknowledged my sin and did not hide my iniquity. I said, ‘Against myself I will admit my iniquity to the Lord’, and you forgave the ungodliness of my heart. For this every holy one will pray to you at a fitting moment. Except in a flood of many waters they will not come near him. For you are my refuge from the affliction which surrounds me, my joy to deliver me from those who have surrounded me. ‘I will make you understand and guide you in the way in which you should go. I will fix my eyes upon you. Do not become like horse and mule, who have no understanding. With bit and bridle you must constrain their cheeks so that they do not come near you.’ Many are the scourges of the sinner, but mercy will surround the one who hopes in the Lord. Rejoice in the Lord and be glad you righteous, and boast all you upright in heart.

Brethren, as many of us as were baptized into Christ were baptized into his death. We were buried then with him through baptism to death, so that, just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, we too might walk in newness of life. For if we have grown into union with him through a death like his, we shall also be united with him in the resurrection. For we know that our old self was crucified with him, so that our sinful body might be done away with, that we might no longer be in slavery to sin. For one who has died has been justified from sin. If then we died with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him. For we know that Christ, being raised from the dead, dies no more; death no longer lords it over him. As to dying, he died once and for all; as to living, he lives for God. Consequently, you also must consider yourselves dead to sin, but alive to God in Christ Jesus our Lord.

At that time the eleven Disciples journeyed to Galilee, to the mountain which Jesus had commanded them. And when they saw him they worshipped him; but some doubted. And Jesus drew near and said to them, ‘All authority has been given to me in heaven and on earth. Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all the things that I have commanded you. And see, I am with you all days until the end of the age. Amen’.

Master and Lord, who have granted your servant forgiveness of sins through holy Baptism, and given him/her the grace of a life of rebirth, be well pleased for the illumination of your face to shine for ever in his/her heart; keep the shield of his/her faith safe from attack by foes; preserve on him/her the garment of incorruption, which he/she has put on, undefiled and unstained; by your grace keeping the spiritual seal unbroken in him/her, and being merciful to him/her and to us. For blessed and glorified is your all-honoured and majestic Name, of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit, now and for ever, and to the ages of ages.

Do you yourself, Master, who through your vessel of election, the Apostle Paul, ordered us to do all things to your glory, bless your servant
